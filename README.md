Pyzapline_plus

Pyzapline_plus is a Python adaptation of the Zapline-plus library, designed to automatically remove spectral peaks like line noise from EEG data while preserving the integrity of the non-noise spectrum and maintaining the data rank. Similar to its MATLAB counterpart, Pyzapline_plus searches for noise frequencies, divides the data into spatially stable chunks, and adjusts the cleaning strength dynamically to minimize negative impacts. The package also offers detailed visualizations of the cleaning process.

Quick Start

If you wish to get started right away, you can use Pyzapline_plus with any EEG data matrix and sampling rate like this:

import numpy as np
from pyzapline_plus import zapline_plus

# Load your data (example)
data = np.load('synthetic_eeg_data.npy')
sampling_rate = 1000

# Clean the data
cleaned_data = zapline_plus(data, sampling_rate)

Integration with MNE

If you are using the MNE-Python library, Pyzapline_plus can be easily integrated into your MNE workflow for EEG preprocessing.

from mne import io
from pyzapline_plus import zapline_plus

# Load your MNE data object
raw = io.read_raw_fif('sample_raw.fif', preload=True)
data = raw.get_data()
sampling_rate = raw.info['sfreq']

# Clean the data
cleaned_data = zapline_plus(data, sampling_rate)
raw._data = cleaned_data  # Update the raw object

Detailed User Guide
